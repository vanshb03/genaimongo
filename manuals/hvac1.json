The power supply to the outdoor unit requires a service disconnect at the unit.  Only use a dedicated circuit.  Never share a power source connected to this system. Insufficient electrical capacity or defects in electrical work can cause electrical shock or fire.\n \uf084 For all electrical work, use the specified cables. Connect \ncables tightly, and clamp them securely to prevent external forces from damaging the terminal. Improper electrical connections can overheat and cause fire, and may also cause shock.\n \uf084 All wiring must be properly arranged to ensure that the \ncontrol board cover can close properly. If the control board cover is not closed properly, it can lead to corrosion and cause the connection points on the terminal to heat up, catch fire, or cause electrical shock.\n \uf084 In certain functional environments, such as kitchens, server \nrooms, etc., the use of specially designed air-conditioning units is highly recommended.\n \uf084 If the power supply cord is damaged, it must be replaced \nby the manufacturer, its service agent or similarly qualified persons such as a licensed electrician in order to avoid a hazard.\n \uf084 The product must be properly grounded at the time of \ninstallation, or electrical shock may occur.\n       CAUTION: BURN HAZARD\n \uf084 For units that have an auxiliary electric heater, do not \ninstall the unit within 1 meter (3 feet) of any combustible materials.\n \uf084 Do not install the unit in a location that may be exposed \nto combustible gas leaks. If combustible gas accumulates around the unit, it may cause fire.\n \uf084 Do not operate your air conditioner in a wet room such as a \nbathroom or laundry room. Too much exposure to water can cause electrical components to short circuit.\n       NOTICE: PROPERTY DAMAGE \n \uf084 Install condensate drainage piping according to the \ninstructions in this manual.

Make sure that the \nhole is drilled at a slight downward angle, so that the outdoor end of the hole is lower than the indoor end by about 12mm (0.5in). This will ensure proper water drainage (See Fig. 33). Place the protective wall cu\ufb00   in the hole.

Use a vacuum pump and manifold gauge to evacuate the refrigerant circuit, removing any non-condensable gas and moisture from the system. \nEvacuation should be performed upon initial installation and when unit is relocated.\nBefore performing evacuation\n \uf084 Check to make sure that both high-pressure and low-pressure pipes \nbetween the indoor and outdoor units are connected properly in accordance with the Refrigerant Piping Connection section of this manual. \n \uf084 Check to make sure all wiring is connected properly.\n \uf084 Perform nitrogen leak check on all refrigerant joints.\n10.2    Evacuation Instructions\nBefore using the manifold gauge and vacuum pump, read their operation manuals \nto familiarize yourself with how to use them properly.\nFigure 59Manifold Gauge\nCompound gauge\n-76cmHg\nor -29.92\"Hg\nLow pressure valveHigh pressure  \nvalve\nPressure hose / \nCharge hoseCharge hose\nVacuum\npumpPressure gauge\nLow pressure valve\n1.

Open the Low Pressure side of the manifold gauge. Keep the High Pressure \nside closed.\n4. Turn on the vacuum pump to evacuate the system.5. Run the vacuum until the Compound Meter reads -76cmHg / -29.92 \"Hg \n(-101 kPa). It is recommended to use a micron gauge; run the vacuum until the micron gauge reads 350 to 500 microns or less.\n6. Close the Low Pressure side of the manifold gauge, and turn o\ufb00   the vacuum \npump.7. Wait for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, then check that there has been no \nchange in system pressure. It is recommended to use a micron gauge; check to make sure the system is still below 500 microns.\nFigure 60 Flare nut\nCap\nValve body\nValve stem\n8. Remove the charge hose from the service port. \n9. Using allen wrench, fully open both the high pressure and low pressure \nvalves. \n10.
